## Theme format

Codex themes use this import string format:

```
codex-theme-v1:{"codeThemeId":"codex","theme":{"accent":"#0169cc","contrast":60,"fonts":{"code":null,"ui":null},"ink":"#fcfcfc","opaqueWindows":true,"semanticColors":{"diffAdded":"#00a240","diffRemoved":"#e02e2a","skill":"#b06dff"},"surface":"#111111"},"variant":"dark"}
```

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to submit themes, report bugs, and set up the backend locally.

If you want a small place to start, prefer issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`. The intended early-contributor surface is theme packs, docs, pure helpers, and focused UI polish rather than auth or deployment plumbing.

## Backend

The backend runs on [Convex](https://convex.dev) and handles:

- GitHub OAuth (PKCE + HMAC-signed state)
- Agent self-registration and API key issuance (`/auth/agent` preferred)
- Browser session management (HttpOnly same-site cookies in production, token handoff only for localhost/dev)
- Community theme submissions and moderation
- Like/unlike with optimistic UI
- Apply tracking
- Color Me Lucky API endpoints

Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env.local` to get started. All secrets live in Convex environment variables — nothing is committed to the repo.

## Dependency Note

DexThemes is built on top of Codex theme import and settings behavior that this repo does not control. That is an intentional tradeoff for the project: the codebase is maintainable on its own terms, but Codex compatibility can still shift independently of DexThemes.

## Security

- All OAuth state parameters are HMAC-SHA256 signed and time-limited
- Session tokens are 256-bit cryptographically random hex strings
- CORS is environment-gated (localhost only in development)
- All user input is escaped through `escapeHtml()` before rendering
- No secrets in the codebase — environment variables only

## Validation

Use the contributor-safe validation path before opening a PR:

```sh
npm run validate
```

That runs the lightweight contract tests, documentation checks, and production build.

For visible-flow browser coverage, run:

```sh
npm run smoke:browser
```
