# DexThemes API

DexThemes exposes two public-facing surfaces:

- the website/published docs surface on `https://www.dexthemes.com`
- the direct Convex HTTP surface on `https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site`

Use the website for public browsing and discovery docs. Use the direct Convex base URL for authenticated and generator HTTP examples.

## Public discovery surface

- Theme catalog: `https://www.dexthemes.com/api/themes`
- Category routes:
  - `https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site/themes`
  - `https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site/themes/community`
  - `https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site/themes/codex`
  - `https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site/themes/dexthemes`
  - `https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site/themes/dexthemes/video-games`
- LLM docs: `https://www.dexthemes.com/llms.txt`
- OpenAPI: `https://www.dexthemes.com/.well-known/openapi.json`

## Direct API base URL

`https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site`

## Authentication model

- Browser users on [dexthemes.com](https://dexthemes.com) authenticate with a secure session cookie after OAuth sign-in.
- Agents and scripts authenticate with a `dxt_...` API key in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Localhost/dev-only OAuth bootstrap may still pass a temporary session token through the callback hash so the browser can convert it into the local session mode. That is not the intended public production contract.

### Color Harmonies

Each generated theme uses one of six color harmony strategies:

- **complementary** — two colors opposite on the color wheel
- **analogous** — three adjacent colors
- **triadic** — three evenly spaced colors
- **split-complementary** — a base color plus two colors adjacent to its complement
- **tetradic** — four evenly spaced colors
- **monochromatic** — single hue with saturation/lightness variations

### Examples

```sh
# Generate a random dark theme
curl https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site/api/color-me-lucky

# Generate a light theme
curl https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site/api/color-me-lucky?variant=light

# Generate with a custom name
curl "https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site/api/color-me-lucky?variant=dark&name=Ocean+Breeze"
```

## Submit a Theme

Submit a generated theme to the [DexThemes gallery](https://www.dexthemes.com). Requires authentication.

```
POST /api/color-me-lucky/submit
```

### Authentication

You must be signed in to DexThemes.

For browser use on [dexthemes.com](https://dexthemes.com), the app authenticates with its secure session cookie after sign-in.
For scripted calls, prefer an API key (`dxt_...`) from the agent/auth flow and send it as:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-dexthemes-api-key>
```

## CORS

The API has open CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`). You can call it from any origin — browser apps, CLI tools, Codex skills, etc.

## Rate limits

DexThemes applies IP and user-based rate limiting on sensitive routes. Public reads are intentionally generous; authenticated writes are tighter.

## License

The Color Me Lucky API is free to use. The generated themes and import strings are yours to keep. Attribution is appreciated but not required.
