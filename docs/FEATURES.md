## Social & Community

### Authentication
- **GitHub sign-in** via OAuth
- **Agent registration** for API-based access
- **Session management** with expiring tokens that fall back to signed-out UI when invalid
- **User menu** with profile, achievements, leaderboard, logout

### Likes
- **Like any theme** (requires sign-in — shows friendly chat prompt if not signed in)
- **Like counts** displayed on theme cards and OG share images
- **One like per user per theme** (enforced server-side)

### Sharing
- **Share on X** generates tweet with vanity URL (e.g., `dexthemes.com/terminator-future-war/dark`)
- **Dynamic OG cards** — each theme gets a custom 1200x630 PNG with code preview, color palette, theme name, and like count
- **Edge-cached OG images** (24h on Vercel CDN, 7-day stale-while-revalidate)
- **Cache warm-up system** — `npm run warm-cache` pre-populates edge cache for all ~200 theme URLs; also runs daily via Vercel cron at 6am UTC with secret-gated API access

### Variant Request System
- **Non-authors** can request the missing variant ("Request Light Variant") — one request per user per theme, tracked in localStorage + backend
- **Authors** see a card: "Complete the set — Add Light Variant" with request count
- **Add variant flow** opens the builder pre-filled with the theme's name and existing accent, targeting the opposite variant

### Leaderboard

- **Tabs**: This Month / All Time
- **Accessible** from the user menu

## Safety & Moderation

### Anti-Abuse Flag System
- **Account age gate**: Must be 24h+ old to flag
- **Daily flag cap**: 3 flags per user per day
- **No self-flagging**: Can't flag your own themes
- **Automated moderation at threshold**: When a theme hits 5 flags, the system re-runs content moderation (name, ID, summary) — if clean, flags reset to 0 (false report protection); if violation confirmed, theme auto-removed
- **Color release on removal**: Protected color combinations freed when flagged theme is removed
- **Stat voiding**: Leaderboard stats from removed themes are voided
- **Content moderation**: Checks theme name, ID, and summary against profanity/slur list on submission

### Color Protection
- **Official Codex, DexThemes originals, and unlock theme color palettes** are protected — submissions that are too similar (< 15 distance across surface/ink/accent) are rejected
- **Dual enforcement**: Client-side warning + server-side rejection
- **Community submissions stay flaggable**: new community themes are not auto-protected from reports

## Technical Platform

### API
- **Public theme catalog API** at `https://dexthemes.com/api/themes`
- **Authenticated/Convex API** at `https://acrobatic-corgi-867.convex.site/`
- **Preferred public docs surface**: `https://dexthemes.com/api/themes`, `https://dexthemes.com/llms.txt`, `https://dexthemes.com/.well-known/openapi.json`
